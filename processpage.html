I want to explore every corner and knowledge of this world. When I start to grow up, being A new media or multiple media artist is my dream career. In this project, I focus to create my personal website that shows my path to growth as a multiple media artist. The goal of this website is to 
                exhibit my personal style works and abilities in the online gallery and pages and shows my personal brand. And I will upload my latest work and experience on it. I hope I can narrate a personal brand that loves travel, painting, photography, drawing, computing and design. But also, I want to create works that have a special calm and wild style to show the scenes of the true world and digital world. I want to use the website to let the public see my works and increase my personal influence. Also, I want to get help from colleagues and more job opportunities related to multiple media. In conclusion, I want to create a stage to show off my personality and my personal brand and abilities and background.</p>

                  "Explore" has "latest", "about me" and "abilities and honours", which is all about the information about me. by following the rule of time I put the latest page the first, and then the about me page and the honours page.
                  "Gallery" also has 2 inner pages which are "photos" and "more works". I put series works in Photo and other classification works in more works, which is clear to explore and see.
                The footer has some basic options, except the privacy policy and donate. users and jump to the latest pages by clicking newsletter and contact page by clicking contact. It gives them more possibility to jump to other pages.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-white">By following the principle of disclosure, I don't put too much content when users first come into my pages, I just give a title and a simple description. So, this website can give them a clear and comfortable feel. But, I have set up a scrolling sign at the bottom of the page, which mentioned to users there is more to explore if they scroll down.  Once they scroll down, they will see examples of some main inner pages, by following the principle of examples. At the first, they will see the latest content, which is the most recent. then they will see a slide of works and finally they will see the about me content. I use different parts to separate them, and all of them have the button "explore more" under it, users can freely choose to use the button to explore or use the navigation bar at the top. In each inner page, I design the same starting to maintain the style, But the format of content has been changed to fit the different types of information, 
                  <br>
                  Such as the latest page I choose to use one card to take a whole col, and users must scroll down to see old ones, which emphasized the time from latest to oldest. Each card has a top part of the video, which is an example related to the content to help users better understand. <br>
                  About me page is a full-text page, I put My picture at the top and the slogan, which is also an example of the article below, so users can know what I will say below and choose to read or not.
                  The abilities page has the format of the list which shows all my abilities and experiences and information.<br>
                  The photo pages show photos of different series. By following the principle of disclosure and example, I only put one photo as an example with some text to describe each series and hid the other photos. If users are interested in this series they can click to open and check all works belonging to this series, once they are so interesting and want to see the details, they can click the images and make them larger on their screen and it will become a slide page. at the bottom, I also hid too much content but I put a button to explore more.<br>
                  The page of more work is a simple gallery list that has 3 works in a line, visitors can click to zoom out and watch it. Also, the button explores more been put at the bottom for further reading.<br>
                The page of contact has two tabs of contact and social, users can choose the Mr. or ms. in the form and their name and basic information and send it to me if they want they can follow me at the social page.</p>

                  The main colour of this object I choose to use dark blue to create a feeling of quiet and emptiness. 
                  And choose white to be the letter color to increase the contrast with the background.
                  I want this website to have a simple, easy style that lets users can easily find what they want.
                  But also, not too simple that looks very unorganized. In typography, I choose to emphasize the topic. There are different background colour to divide the area to make the web looks more organized and professional. Also, for the gallery part. I put frames under every picture, which makes them clearer and easier to watch.
                  white-spacing is very important to my project, If the web is too full, the feeling of quiet and empty will be destroyed, but if it is too much white-spacing there, the whole page will look unfinished, and hard to read,
                  Logo: The logo is a combination of the words” Life as Adventure” and a simple line frame. Which is a simple logo but very clear and impressive. <hr>
